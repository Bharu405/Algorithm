Write an Algorithm for Accepting the distances and speed values for particular journey,calculate the time taken for the journey and display the same
STEP1 :START
STEP2 :the user to enter the distance of the journey in kilometers
STEP3 :Read the input distance as a float value
STEP4 :the user to enter the speed of the journey in kilometers per hour
STEP5 :Read the input speed as a float value
STEP6 :Divide the distance by the speed to calculate the time taken for the journey
STEP7 :Display the time taken for the journey in hours to the user
STEP6 :STOP
