STEP4 :Check if the age is valid by making sure it is a positive integer
	STEP4.1 :If the age is not valid, display an error message and end the program
	STEP4.2 :If the age is valid, check the age range to determine the user's age group:
		STEP4.2.1 :If the age is less than 18, the user is a kid or teenager
		STEP4.2.2 : If the age is less than 13, the user is a kid
		STEP4.2.3 : If the age is between 13 and 17, the user is a teenager
			STEP4.2.3.1 :If the age is between 18 and 59, the user is an adult
			STEP4.2.3.2 :If the age is 60 or greater, the user is a senior citizen
				STEP4.2.3.2.1Display the user's age group to the user
STEP5 :stop
